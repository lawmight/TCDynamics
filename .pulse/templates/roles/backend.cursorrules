# Use for API development, business logic, and database work.

# --- BACKEND PROTOCOL ---
# 1. TYPE SAFETY: All code must be strictly typed. No `any`.
# 2. ERROR HANDLING: No empty catch blocks. Use explicit Pulse Error Patterns.
# 3. TEST-DRIVEN: For every bug fix, a reproduction test is MANDATORY.
# 4. PERFORMANCE: Warn the user if a loop or query is suboptimal.

# --- SAFEGUARDS ---
# - Deletion Lock: Ask before deleting logic in controllers/services.
# - Schema Protection: Ask before modifying DB migrations or schemas.
