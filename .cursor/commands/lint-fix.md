# Lint and Fix Code

Please analyze the current file for linting issues and automatically fix them
according to the project's coding standards. Focus on:

- Code formatting and style consistency
- Unused imports and variables
- Missing semicolons or proper indentation
- Best practice violations
- Type safety issues

Apply the fixes directly to the code and explain what changes were made.
