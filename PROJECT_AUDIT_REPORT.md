## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. **EXPOSED CREDENTIALS IN REPOSITORY** 🔴

**Severity: CRITICAL**

Found hardcoded credentials in multiple files:

- **README.md (lines 120-125)**: Zoho email password exposed
  ```
  EMAIL_USER=contact@workflowai.fr
  EMAIL_PASS=gsdSk4MQk3ck  ← EXPOSED PASSWORD
  ```
- **env.example (lines 5-6)**: Same credentials in example file

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**

1. Change the Zoho password immediately
2. Remove credentials from all documentation
3. Rotate all potentially exposed secrets
4. Add these files to git history cleanup

### 2. **Missing Dependencies for Testing** 🟡

- Frontend: `vitest` not installed despite being in scripts
- Backend: Python testing dependencies not installed in container
- Tests cannot run in current environment

│   ├── Email integration via Nodemailer
│   └── Security middleware (Helmet, CORS, Rate limiting)
└── Azure Functions (Python)
    ├── Contact form handler
    ├── Multi-backend database support
    └── Admin dashboard with analytics
```

### **Strengths** ✅

1. **Multi-tier Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
2. **Modern Stack**: React 18.3, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS
3. **Security Layers**: Rate limiting, input validation, XSS protection
4. **Database Flexibility**: Supports both Cosmos DB and Table Storage
5. **Monitoring**: Health checks, admin dashboard, performance metrics
6. **PWA Features**: Offline support, service worker
7. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

### **Weaknesses** ⚠️

1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: Critical security vulnerability
2. **Test Coverage**: Only ~15% frontend coverage
3. **Missing Test Dependencies**: Tests cannot run
4. **Local API URLs**: Frontend hardcoded to localhost:3001
5. **No API Documentation**: Missing OpenAPI/Swagger specs

---

## 🔒 Security Assessment

### **Implemented Security Features** ✅

- ✅ Input sanitization with Bleach (Python) and Joi (Node.js)
- ✅ Rate limiting (5 requests/15 min per IP)
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Helmet.js for security headers
- ✅ Email validation
- ✅ XSS protection
- ✅ Environment variable support
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement in production

### **Security Vulnerabilities** 🔴

1. **Exposed Credentials**: Passwords in documentation
2. **Admin Key**: Default admin key in example files
3. **CORS**: Currently allows all origins (\*)
