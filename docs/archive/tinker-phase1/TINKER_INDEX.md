## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I cherry-pick optimizations?**  
A: Yes! Each optimization is independent. Start with what makes sense for you.

**Q: Will this break my code?**  
A: No. All optimizations maintain existing functionality. Tests verify this.

**Q: Can I pause and resume?**  
A: Absolutely. Each optimization is a natural stopping point.

**Q: Do I need to do all 15?**  
A: No. Even doing just the 3 Quick Wins provides significant value.

**Q: What if tests fail?**  
A: See TINKER_QUICK_WINS.md → Common Issues & Solutions
