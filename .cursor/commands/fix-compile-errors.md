# Fix Compile Errors

Please analyze the compilation errors in the current codebase and provide fixes
for them. Focus on:

- Type mismatches and casting issues
- Missing imports or dependencies
- Syntax errors and malformed code
- Undefined variables or functions
- Configuration issues

For each error:

1. Identify the root cause
2. Provide the corrected code
3. Explain why the fix resolves the issue

Make the necessary changes to resolve all compilation errors.
