# Write Unit Tests

Create comprehensive unit tests for the current code. Include:

## Test Coverage

- Test all public methods and functions
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Aim for high code coverage

## Test Structure

- Use the project's testing framework conventions
- Write clear, descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Group related tests logically

## Test Cases to Include

- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error handling and exception cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Test Quality

- Make tests independent and isolated
- Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable
- Keep tests simple and focused on one thing
- Add helpful assertion messages

Generate the test file with proper imports and setup according to the project's
testing conventions.
