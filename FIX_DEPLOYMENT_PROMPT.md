# TCDynamics Deployment Status - Current State

## Mission: Maintain and Monitor Stable Deployment Pipeline

The TCDynamics deployment pipeline has been successfully fixed and is now stable. This document outlines what's working and any remaining maintenance tasks.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED & WORKING - DO NOT CHANGE

**Core Infrastructure (STABLE):**

- ‚úÖ Azure Functions deployment pipeline with comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Authentication method: Azure CLI with service principal (`func-tcdynamics-contact`)
- ‚úÖ Function app naming standardized throughout codebase
- ‚úÖ Environment variable configuration centralized with validation
- ‚úÖ GitHub workflow: `.github/workflows/tcdynamics-hybrid-deploy.yml`
- ‚úÖ DNS resolution issues resolved with diagnostic checks

**Application Components (STABLE):**

- ‚úÖ React frontend builds successfully with optimized bundles
- ‚úÖ Azure Functions Python v2 model with enhanced security
- ‚úÖ Centralized API client: `src/api/azureServices.ts` with retry logic and caching
- ‚úÖ Configuration management: `src/utils/config.ts` with validation and type safety
- ‚úÖ Security utilities with input sanitization and rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring and optimization

**Documentation (COMPLETE):**

- ‚úÖ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Current deployment procedures
- ‚úÖ `DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY.md` - Deployment status and health checks
- ‚úÖ `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` - Troubleshooting procedures
- ‚úÖ `env.example` - Environment variable templates

## üîÑ ONGOING MAINTENANCE TASKS

### Monitoring & Health Checks (Ongoing)

- [ ] **Weekly**: Check deployment logs in GitHub Actions
- [ ] **Monthly**: Verify all API endpoints are responding correctly
- [ ] **Quarterly**: Review and rotate Azure credentials
- [ ] **As needed**: Monitor performance metrics and error rates

### Environment Updates (As needed)

- [ ] Update environment variables when Azure services change
- [ ] Rotate API keys and secrets according to security policy
- [ ] Update documentation when new features are added
- [ ] Test deployment pipeline after major Azure updates

### Security Maintenance (Ongoing)

- [ ] **Monthly**: Review security logs and access patterns
- [ ] **Quarterly**: Update dependencies and security patches
- [ ] **As needed**: Review and update rate limiting rules
- [ ] **Annual**: Security audit and penetration testing

## üö® EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Deployment Fails

1. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages
2. Verify Azure Function App status in Azure Portal
3. Test API endpoints manually: `https://func-tcdynamics-contact.azurewebsites.net/api/health`
4. Review `AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` for specific troubleshooting steps
5. Contact system administrator if issues persist

### If API Endpoints Fail

1. Check Azure Functions logs in Azure Portal
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test individual endpoints with curl or Postman
4. Check CORS configuration if frontend can't reach backend
5. Review rate limiting and security configurations

## üìã CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS
