# Bump devDependencies using Cursor headless CLI, then verify before pushing.
#
# Safety (follow-up): Verify runs in the same job before any push. We only commit and
# push when lint, type-check, and tests all pass. If the bump breaks anything, the
# job fails and nothing is pushed. No separate "follow-up" job is needed.
#
# Required secret: CURSOR_API_KEY (Cursor dashboard → Integrations → User API Keys).
# Add at: repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.
# Do not commit the key; revoke any key that was ever pasted in chat or logs.

             For each of these files: bump every devDependency to the latest version that respects existing semver ranges (e.g. ^1.0.0 -> latest 1.x). Prefer minor and patch updates only; do not switch to a new major unless the range already allows it.
             After editing all relevant package.json files, run 'npm install' once at the repository root (so package-lock.json and workspace lockfiles stay in sync).
             Do NOT run any git commands (no git add, commit, push, checkout, branch). Only modify package.json files and run npm install."
