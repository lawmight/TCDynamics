# Security Review

Perform a comprehensive security review of the current code. Analyze:

## Authentication & Authorization

- Verify proper authentication mechanisms
- Check authorization controls and permission systems
- Review session management and token handling
- Ensure secure password policies and storage

## Input Validation & Sanitization

- Identify SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Check for XSS and CSRF attack vectors
- Validate all user inputs and API parameters
- Review file upload and processing security

## Data Protection

- Ensure sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
- Check for data exposure in logs and error messages
- Review API responses for information leakage
- Verify proper secrets management

## Infrastructure Security

- Review dependency security and known vulnerabilities
- Check HTTPS configuration and certificate validation
- Analyze CORS policies and security headers
- Review environment variable and configuration security

Provide specific remediation steps with code examples for each security issue
identified.
