## 🎯 Learning Principles

### 1. Learn by BUILDING

❌ Watch 5 hours of tutorials  
✅ Watch 30 min, build for 4.5 hours

### 2. Use AI as Teacher

Ask Cursor:

- "Explain X and show working code"
- "Build Y and explain how it works"
- "Why did you use Z pattern?"

### 3. Build Smallest Working Thing

❌ "Learn everything about Supabase"  
✅ "Sign up one user - just that"

### 4. Deploy Early and Often

- Built login? Deploy it!
- Added upload? Deploy it!
- Seeing it live = motivation boost

### 5. Don't Get Stuck

- Stuck >15 min? Ask Cursor
- Check official docs
- Move to next feature, come back later
